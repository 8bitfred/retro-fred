You need to add the following symbolic links in the android-project
subdirectory for building for Android:

  cd android-project/app/src/main
  ln -s ../../../../assets .
  cd ../../jni
  ln -s ../../../cpp .

As well as the links to SDL and SDL_image (in android-project/app/jni):

  ln -s /usr/local/src/miguel-src/sdl2/SDL2-2.28.5 SDL
  ln -s /usr/local/src/miguel-src/sdl2_image/SDL2_image-2.8.2 SDL_image
